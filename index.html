      <h3>Research</h3>
      <br />
      <p>Due to the recent pandemic, people around the world were required to remain in their respective countries,
        cities, and even their own home therefore no one was allowed to travel for quite some time. But since travel
        restrictions have started to lift, people now more than ever are eager to start planning the trips they had
        hoped
        to go on or have aspired to go on since the lockdown.
        I conducted five 1-on-1 interviews with frequent travellers in Toronto to kick off the user research process and
        supplemented it with a competitor analysis focusing on what their main features are and what is missing from
        them.

      <h3>Definition & Ideation</h3>
      <br />
      <p>Using the information from my user research, I developed the user persona: an adventure-seeking young
        professional who enjoys travelling. Their pain points include having limited time to explore a city to its full
        potential and having to flip through multiple apps for coordinating bookings and itinerary.
        <br /><br />
        The problem then became apparent, there was a need to communicate more efficiently amongst tripmates regarding
        plans which requires juggling between multiple apps. There were several ideas to solve this issue.
      </p>

        alt="image of MergeMapp user affinity diagram">
    </div>
    <p>To solve this issue, the goal of this project focused on reducing the stress and time it takes to
      plan group
      trips by having the users share their own interests with their friends and compiling a group map/itinerary with
      everyone’s pins. Doing this will allow the product to be a hub for travel groups and make planning trips, prior to
      and during, more efficient.</p>

      <h3>Prototyping</h3>
      <br />
      <p>Now for the designing of the app, I sketched up screens pertaining to the app’s main features being searching
        and pinning locations on a map, a compiled list of pinned locations showing who pinned what, the group chat, and
        personal profile with a list of created trips, along with the login/signup screens.

    <p><br /><br />Using the rough sketches and digital wireframes, I created a lo-fi prototype which I used to conduct
      a usability
      test with the objective of making sure the user flow, buttons, and navigation were seamless and intuitive. I
      recruited five participants to complete five simple tasks on the clickable lo-fi prototype which can be seen
      below.

  <!-- Conclusion -->

  <div class="mmConclusion sectionPadding fullWidth text-center">
    <div class="mmConclusion__content">
      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <br />
      <p>Having been my first design challenge and case study, I learned so much about every step of the design process
        and how each phase contributes to the final prototype. These are the most notable things I’ve learned:

        <br /><br />
      <h5>Keep It simple:</h5>

      When developing a product, you will need to either scrap or put on hold many ideas and really focus on one or
      two main functions. Honing in on solving one or two problems will really help you narrow down your ideas.

      <br /><br />
      <h5>Observational and soft-skills are crucial:</h5>

      When conducting user interviews or usability tests, having good observational skills was extremely useful as it
      gave me a deeper understanding of how a user feels or thinks beyond what they say. I also found that during
      these phases, having the soft-skills to make participants feel comfortable and relaxed allowed for more natural,
      expansive and in-depth answers which provided me with crucial information that carried through to the next
      steps.

      <br /><br />
      <h5>Don’t be offended by feedback:</h5>

      Feedback is an essential part of every step of the design process. Regardless of whether it comes from users or
      colleagues, or if it was gentle or harsh, all feedback can be useful.

      <br /><br />
      The next steps for MergeMapp would be to perhaps add a feature that allows users to favourite and
      share/recommend the trips they’ve been on with other users as well as specific locations that they really
      enjoyed. This would expand the purpose and usefulness of the app allowing for more browsability and extend its
      planning resources.
